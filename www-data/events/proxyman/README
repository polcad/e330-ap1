ProxyMan.py

  Asterisk Manager Proxy 
  (included with the Asterisk Event Monitor package)

  This Python script is a multi-threaded server which connects to an
  Asterisk Manager Interface and logs all messages (events) received.

  The basic functionality is as follows:

    Connects to the Asterisk Manager and listens for all events

    Optionally listens on socket and accepts client connections
               proxies all client commands to the Asterisk Manager Interface
               sends all data received from the manager to all connected clients

    Optionally prints data as received (also in optional hex dump format)

    Optionally logs all data to a MySQL database table


  For customization option to enable/disable the option functions, look at the
  ProxMan.py script itself. The comments are the documentation.
  There are also comments showing how to filter out specific events. The filter
  will stop the event from being written to the MySQL database.

delete_events.py
  A python script to delete old events. Run it via a cron job:

events.sql
  MySQL commands to create the asterisk.events table

asterstart.py
  asterstart.py will become a deamon when started and checks that asterisk and
  proxyman.py are running. If not it starts them.

Currently it checks if Asterisk is running. If not it kills any Asterisk related
programs (like ProxyMan.py) and re-starts Asterisk and ProxyMan.py then re-checks
every 10 seconds.
